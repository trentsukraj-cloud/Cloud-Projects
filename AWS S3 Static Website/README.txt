# Welcome to My Awesome Project!

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Trent Sukraj, and this is my personal project showcasing a static website hosted on Amazon S3. I'm excited to share my work with you!

## Project Overview

This project serves as a demonstration of hosting a static website on Amazon S3. It includes a simple setup for static web pages, and I've applied a bucket policy to grant public read access.

## Why This Project?

I created this project to explore the world of static website hosting on AWS and to provide a hands-on example for others interested in doing the same. It's a great starting point for beginners looking to deploy their websites on a scalable and reliable platform.

## Features

- **Static Website**: A collection of static web pages.
- **Public Access**: Utilizes an S3 bucket policy to grant public read access.
- **Easy Deployment**: Follow the simple steps in the README to deploy your own version.
